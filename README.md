# Dockerized Deployment of a FastAPI and React App with Reverse Proxy, Monitoring and Observability

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the deployment of a full-stack application with a FastAPI backend and a React frontend using Docker. It integrates a reverse proxy for routing, and implements comprehensive monitoring and observability using Prometheus, Grafana, Loki, Promtail, and cAdvisor.

The goal is to provide a robust and scalable application infrastructure while showcasing best practices in containerization, monitoring, and cloud deployment. By the end of this project, users will have a fully functional web application deployed on a cloud platform with proper domain configuration, detailed logging, and real-time performance monitoring.
